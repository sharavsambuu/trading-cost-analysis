Trading fee would be different depending on account size, so It would be
helpful to choose account size for analyzing trading fee or commission impact.
Generally, it is preferrable to use cash based equity analysis for commission
impact rather than based on cumulative sum of raw returns, and after that we
can apply commission impact expressed by BPS to raw return based algo analysis.
