# Trading-cost-analysis

  The goal of this repo is to make sense of how trading cost impacted to trading strategies.
  Trading cost is crutial to develop more robust and more realistic strategies.



# Todo

  - Try to apply cost model on higher timeframe as specified on following 
    https://github.com/MicroBioScopicData/Cryptos_Analysis

  - Try to estimate spread_slippage levels for different timeframes

  - Compare it to result backtested on 1m mapped

  - Try out different spread_slippage numbers



# Commission fee based trading cost analysis

  Mostly crypto markets like binance charge through commission fee which is certain percentage of total traded value.

  Experiment on how many BPS of slippage happened from signals generated on 1H

    crypto_rsi_slippage.py

  From the slippage experiment I estimated 0.5BPS is ideal for BTC 1H slippage and backtested with 0.04% commission

    btc_macross_backtesting.py

  Other backtesting method is to map signals from higher timeframe to timeframe with lower granularity like 1m timeframe

    btc_macross_backtesting_1m.py



# Spread based trading cost analysis

  FX brokers tend to charge through spreads

  FX slippage estimation experiment

    fx_rsi_slippage.py

  FX spread estimation experiment

    fx_spread.py

  Slippage and spread involved backtesting

    fx_macross_backtesting.py

  Spread involved backtesting on lower granularity

    fx_macross_backtesting_1m.py
